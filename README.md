# Algorithm Analysis and Synthesis Project 1

### Problem:
The intention is to tile, i.e. cover with tiles, a given area defined on a rectangle
delimited by a stairway, as illustrated in Figure 1. The area to be tiled is
defined on a unit grid, with n rows and m columns. The tiles to be used are always
squares with dimensions on multiple sides of the unit, i.e.: 1 × 1, 2 × 2, etc. Whereas you can use an arbitrary number of square tiles of various dimensions,
there are several possible configurations of the tiles that allow you to completely cover the area
in question.
In the example illustrated in Figure 1, there are 4 possible configurations for tiling the area in
in question. One configuration only uses 1×1 tiles, and the other three
three use 1×1 and 2×2 tiles
